# Ambroisie

Hello there, I'm Bruno.

This GitHub profile is merely a mirror for my self-hosted [Gitea
instance](https://gitea.belanyi.fr). This is done automatically using
[Lohr](https://github.com/alarsyo/lohr).

You can find my blog [here](https://belanyi.fr), and my CV
[there](https://cv.belanyi.fr/en.pdf)
(or in [French here](https://cv.belanyi.fr/fr.pdf))

## About me

I like writing Rust, but am also fluent in C, C++, Python. I know my way around
the shell, and use git proficiently (how would you be reading this otherwise).

I like to self-host some services, and have recently found a passion for using
[Nix and NixOS](https://nixos.org) to have a declarative, reproducible
configuration of my systems.
